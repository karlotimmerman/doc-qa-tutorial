## Doc QA Tutorial

![Demo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7sl6lx63shjbwssbsfl.gif)

A simple document QA app built with Langchain and Streamlit. You can follow my [tutorial]() on [dev.to](https://dev.to/mmz001) to build this app from scratch or just clone this repo and run it locally:

```cmd
git clone
cd doc-qa-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
